            <h3>Dominant-Recessive</h3>
            <p>Dominant-Recessive genes are what you generally learn in school. There is a dominant allele, and a recessive allele. If there is a dominant allele present, then you get the dominant, but if there is only recessive alleles present, then you get the recessive trait. This shows in eye colors of humans.</p>
            <h3>Incomplete</h3>
            <p>Incomplete dominace is when neither allele is fully dominant. It causes a blended/intermediate phenotype. An example of these are the color of petals on flowers.</p>
            <h3>Co-Dominance</h3>
            <p></p>

            <h2>Simulation</h2>
            <p>Below is an interactive simulator to explore genetic inheritance:</p>
            <p>Each trait that the bean has simulates a different inheritance pattern. By clicking New Generation, you create a random (or custom) partner for the bean, and then a offspring is made from those two beans.</p>
            <p>Hands: Dominant-Recessive</p>
            <p>Legs: Incomplete Dominance</p>
            <p>Color: Co-Dominace</p>
            <p>Gender & X Linked: Head Color (Yellow is Male, Black is Female, and Green is X linked mutation)</p>
