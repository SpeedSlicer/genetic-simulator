        <h2>Inheritance Patterns</h2>
        <p></p>
        <h4>
          These examples are oversimplified, and as always, genetics is much
          more complex.
        </h4>
        <h3>Dominant-Recessive</h3>
        <p>
          Dominant-Recessive genes are what you generally learn in school. There
          is a dominant allele, and a recessive allele. If there is a dominant
          allele present, then you get the dominant, but if there is only
          recessive alleles present, then you get the recessive trait. This
          shows in eye colors of humans.

        <h3>Incomplete</h3>
        <p>
          Incomplete dominance is when neither allele is fully dominant. It
          causes a blended/intermediate phenotype. An example of these are the
          color of petals on flowers.

        <h3>Co-Dominance</h3>
        <p>
          Co-Dominance occurs when both genes are dominant, and both traits show
          up. An example of this is cow fur.

        <h3>X-Linked (Recessive)</h3>
        <p>
          X-Linked Recessive traits are traits that are passed down through
          mutations in the X chromosome. Due to it being recessive, requiring
          all X chromosomes to have that mutation, more males are affected than
          females, due to males only having one X chromosome. Females can be
          carriers of this trait though, as the the X chromosome from females
          does pass down to future generations.

        <h3>X-Linked (Dominant) (Not Simulated)</h3>
        <p>
          X-Linked Dominant traits are traits that are passed down through
          mutations in the X chromesome. Due to it being dominant, it only
          requires one X chromesome to be mutated to exist. This means more
          females are affected than males.

        <h2>Simulation</h2>
        <p>Below is an interactive simulator to explore genetic inheritance:</p>
        <p>
          Each trait that the bean has simulates a different inheritance
          pattern. By clicking New Generation, you create a random (or custom)
          partner for the bean, and then a offspring is made from those two
          beans.
